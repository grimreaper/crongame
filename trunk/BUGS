*1) game does not restart on lost lives
*2) when ball is on fire - bounces when hitting brick of > 1 life (feature/bug? - I'm inclined to say feature) --> its a feature
3) ball on fire is too powerfull
*4) automated install fails on all OSes
5) Make does not seem to catch all deps. When I modify some files other files don't get rebuilt when they should
6) unbreakable bricks can break levels (in random mode)
7) ball goes through unbreakable bricks for some reason
8) Pause kills the timer and doesn't restart.
