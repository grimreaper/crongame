=== Compile ===
To install you need to run "make <operating system>".
This will get the pmake (BSD make version) package from your OS's package
manager (apt, emerge, etc).
If you used the above instructions to get pmake the following will occur
automatically.
Run "[p]make deps-<operating system>" to fetch and install the allegro 
library. This will generate some warnings as the Makefile tries to run
allegro specific config programs. You can ignore these.

If you already have either of the above the Makefile will detect it.
Finally run "[p]make install" to compile and install crongame.

The installation proccess checks to make sure you are root. If you wish
to override this behavior add a file .noroot to the build directory.

For some reason pmake doesn't work on ubuntu. Instead of pmake run 
./scripts/run-install-ubuntu.sh
