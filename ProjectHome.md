CronGame is a simple breakout game.

Long term goal: be a decent rival to lbreakout2 using only ANSI standard c++.

Short term goal: be a simple and easy to understand breakout game that encourages users to read, modify, and extend the code.

Anyone interested in working together to work on the game, learn c++, or anything else please contact me. If you are just starting to learn c++ this project is for you. If you are an experienced c++ developer and are interested in helping others learn this project is also for you. Artists, musicians, documenters, and anyone else interested in working with the project should also contact me.

This project uses the allegro library (although knowledge of the library is not needed to work on the code).
